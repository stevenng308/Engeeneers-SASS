# Engeeneers-SASS
Engeeneers Super Armor Set Search (SASS) is full microservice system created for the game Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. There has been a demand for a web based version of Athena's Armor Set Search and the only other web alternative is not as robust or satisfactory. This service is to address that, hopefully, and can be used with other applications available for MH4U. Many thanks go out to Athena's dat ASS, kamegami13 and team of Monster Hunter 4U Database for the database and BreakDS's web implementation (sry no speak LISP here). License to be determined.
